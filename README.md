## :closed_book: The Statistics & Metrics
The statistics you are shown are:
1. Your coding personalities! There are 8 unique personalities you can get:
    - **The Marathon Coder**: For users who have coded for atleast 15 days straight (code includes any contributions).
    - **The Night Owl**: If most of your commits happened around 12am (to 6am)!
    - **The Early Bird**: If most of your commits happened around 6am (to 12pm)!
    - **The Debugger**: For users who have made over 100 commits in one year.
    - **The Stargazer**: If your repositories have been starred over 15 times.
    - **The Trailblazer**: If you have made over 20 repositories in one year!
    - **The Code Connoisseur**: For users who have coded in more than 5 languages in 2024!
    - **The Human**: For those who did not match any personalities (kind of rare!)
2. Your top languages of the year (based on total lines of code).
3. The no. of repositories, commits and pull requests in 2024.
4. Your most active date of the year (and the most active day of the week).
5. Your monthly contribution heatmap.
6. A polar area chart of your contribution types (pull requests, reviews, commits, etc.)
7. Your longest coding streak, as well as general active hours.
8. Your most starred repository.
9. Your most common commit message (for me, it was _"Update README.md"_!)
10. And finally, the total lines of code (including additions and deletions) you pushed in 2024, which is used to get the daily average!

## :question: How to contribute?
Feel free to clone the project and go through the code (it is a bit of a mess - sorry!), then please add any statistics and metrics you want!
